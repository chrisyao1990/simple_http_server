==== Build ====

To build the code, run 'make -f Makefile.{platform}' on a command-line 
in the folder where the file `src` folder.

  make -f Makefile.Linux
  make -f Makefile.Omnios
  make -f Makefile.Netbsd

The resulting binary is called 'sws'.

==== Run ====

Run the sws in debugging mode (command-line option -d) to see output on stdout.

==== Address Logging ====

The corresponding IPv6 address of connected IPv4 clients is logged to have a
uniform logging format, if the server listens on all available addresses.

If the server listens on an IPv4 address only, then we log client addresses
in the IPv4 format.
